# Project 4
### Title: Ramadan Mubarak
#### Idea: 
Ultimate goal is to have an app that works like shazam.
Scaling down...
		
1. Create a *Quran* app where you can play and listen to the _Quran_.
2. So I would need a database that contains audio files.
3. I will use the Al-Quran api that returns arabic text and audio by surah, ayah etc.
4. So you can read it and comment on it.

#### MVP / User Stories:
1. be able to see the quran by click on the titles and render the surah/chapter
2. be able to play and pause the quran
3. be able to leave comments, which equals CRUD implementation

As a user, I want to be able to see the table of contents that shows all of the titles of the surahs. I also want to be able to click on each title individually and render the text of the surah. Next I want to be able to play the surah while reading along with the text. Lastly, I want to express my feelings about what I just read or the app in general by leaving comments below.
